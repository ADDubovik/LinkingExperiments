C++11 final draft - n3797

3.5 Program and linkage [basic.link]
(4) An unnamed namespace or a namespace declared directly or indirectly within an unnamed namespace has
internal linkage. All other namespaces have external linkage. A name having namespace scope that has not
been given internal linkage above has the same linkage as the enclosing namespace if it is the name of
- a variable; or
- a function; or
- a named class (Clause 9), or an unnamed class defined in a typedef declaration in which the class has
the typedef name for linkage purposes (7.1.3); or
- a named enumeration (7.2), or an unnamed enumeration defined in a typedef declaration in which the
enumeration has the typedef name for linkage purposes (7.1.3); or
- an enumerator belonging to an enumeration with linkage; or
- a template.

C++14 final draft - N3936 and C++17 draft n4713 - the same under [basic.link] section.
